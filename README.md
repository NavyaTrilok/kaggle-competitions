Feature Branch has -

1) feature/classification - for classification tasks
2) feature/regression - for regression tasks
3) feature/clustering - for unsupervised algorithms
4) feature/DeepLearning - for DeepLearning practice


Note: I am still building this repository, so this is my plan, I will push the jupyter notebooks I practiced earlier and going to practice to these branches.
